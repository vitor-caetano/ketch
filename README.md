## Getting Started

### Download and Install Ketch 
The latest Ketch release can be found [here](https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch/releases). Use the following commands
to install Ketch, 

Install latest at /usr/local/bin default location

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shipa-corp/ketch/main/install.sh | bash
```

Alternatively, you can install specific tag at a target location, for example command below installs ketch version v0.2.1 in current directory:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shipa-corp/ketch/main/install.sh | INSTALL_DIR=. TAG=v0.2.1  bash
```



### Install Ingress Controller

At present, Ketch supports Istio and Traefik ingress controllers.

Here is how you can install Traefik:

Use [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install Traefik. 

```bash 
helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
helm repo update
helm install traefik traefik/traefik
```

Or you can install Istio:

```bash
curl -Ls https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.9.0 sh -
export PATH=$PWD/istio-1.9.0/bin:$PATH
istioctl install --set profile=demo 
```

### Install Cert Manager.
```bash
kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.3/cert-manager.yaml
```
### Install Ketch controller.
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch/releases/download/v0.2.1/ketch-controller.yaml
```

Thats it!

## Using Ketch 

Learn more about Ketch at [Ketch documentation](https://learn.theketch.io/docs)

### Quick Start
Deploying apps is easy once you've installed Ketch.  First, create a pool. Then create app(s) adding them to the pool and finally 
deploy the app(s).  The following example illustrates these steps. 

```bash
# Add a pool with ingress Traefik (default), replace ingress IP address by your ingress IP address
ketch pool add mypool  --ingress-service-endpoint 35.247.8.23 --ingress-type traefik

# Create app
ketch app create bulletinboard --pool mypool       

# Deploy app
ketch app deploy bulletinboard -i docker.io/shipasoftware/bulletinboard:1.0 

# Check app status
ketch app list 

NAME             POOL        STATE        ADDRESSES                                      PLATFORM    DESCRIPTION
bulletinboard    mypool      1 running    http://bulletinboard.35.247.8.23.shipa.cloud
```
After you deploy your application, you can access it at the address associated with it using the `ketch app list`, in 
this example `bulletinboard.35.247.8.23.shipa.cloud`.
